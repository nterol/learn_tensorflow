# Learn Tensorflow.js

My aim with this project is to understand to possibilities Tensorflow has to offer to web development. 

At the moment I am only following tensorflow tutorial : 
[Tensorflow tutoriel](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflowjs-object-detection/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0)

Is it possible to: 
- detect objects on camera ? -> ✅
- measure temperature ? ⚙️


And because I just love React, this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
